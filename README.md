# About
This repository contains all of my dotfiles. I use a lot of shortcuts/aliases
and a small assortment of Vim plugins. To be productive on a new system, I rely
on these customizations.

This repository is dual-purposed. It version controls all of my environment
changes, but also contains everything I need in order to get up and running
(immediately) on a brand new system.

# Installation
```bash
./install.sh
```
